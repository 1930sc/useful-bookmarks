#### This repo is dedicated to list of useful bookmarks that I bookmarked when discovering something new or while learning programming

### Things to be Done
* [x] Implement Search 
* [x] Host it on Netlify
* [ ] Categorize the bookmarks


### Markdown Version
[Bookmarks](bookmarks.md)
* Note: This file is a little messy and most of my bookmarks are duplicated but hosted version is better and has fuzzy search functionality
* Fuzzy search was implemented using `listjs`
