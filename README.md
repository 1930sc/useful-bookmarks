# useful-bookmarks

#### This repo is dedicated to list of useful bookmarks that I bookmarked when discovering something new or while learning programming

## [Useful-Bookmarks](https://kind-babbage-78b799.netlify.com)


### Things to be Done
* [x] Implement Search 
* [x] Host it on Netlify
* [ ] Categorize the bookmarks


### Markdown Version
[Bookmarks](bookmarks.md)
* Fuzzy search was implemented using `listjs`

### Note
This project has another [dev](https://github.com/mraza007/useful-bookmarks/tree/flask) branch that uses flask as backend server and bookmarks are stored in sheets and used an api.
